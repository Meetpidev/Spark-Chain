# Spark Chain
Spark Chain is a remix-driven, collaborative challenge platform designed for rapid, iterative idea evolution. The core technical idea is to enable real-time, multi-team engagement-where teams pass, remix, and evolve ideas in cycles-using a robust, scalable web application stack 

A multi-round challenge where teams remix each otherâ€™s ideas in rapid cycles, fostering iterative innovation without ownership bias. Combines hackathon intensity with TikTok-style remix culture.
